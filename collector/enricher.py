Realtime data for 2016 is collected and published on a weekly basis, and will continue to be made available through the Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS) website and on this page.

Due to the realtime nature of data collection which results in occasional reporting lags, and/or insufficient detail in early event reports for inclusion in the dataset, a small number of events in the 2016 data pre-date this period. These have been coded and published for the first time in 2016 and do not duplicate any events found in the full published dataset.

Data files are updated each Monday, containing data from the previous week. The data files below include a single running file for all 2016 data, with monthly files updated on an ongoing basis.""",
